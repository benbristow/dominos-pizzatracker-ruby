# Domino's (unofficial) Pizza Tracker

## Why?
I was bored and waiting for my pizza to arrive. Also, the official pizza tracker web-app takes up too much valuable screen space.

## How to use it (It's simple... really!)
`ruby dominos_tracker.rb YOUR_PIZZA_ID`

You can get your Pizza ID by visiting the official pizza tracker and taking the ID from the URL.
Probably only works for UK orders though. (Although would work elsewhere with a tiny bit of tweaking)

## Any gems needed?
Nope. As long as you have a recent version of Ruby you should be good to go.
